EXPERIMENT 1:
==============

AIM:
==

  To understand the basis of python programming and write simple programs.

  

THEORY:
=

  Print Command:
  In Python, the print() function is used to display output on the screen. It can print text, numbers, and the values of variables. Multiple items can be printed     together using commas inside the print() function.

  Variables:
  Variables in Python are used to store data values. A variable is created by assigning a value using the = operator. Python is dynamically typed, so the type of     variable is decided automatically at runtime.
  

CODE-1
=

Values are taken from the user and then the operations are performed.

ALGORITHM
=

1.Start

2.Taking the values of x and y from the user

3.Performing different operations and printing the results.

4.End

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CODE-2:
=

First value of r is taken from the user and then math library is imported which automatically calculates the value of pi in the formula of area of circle and then prints the value.

ALGORITHM:
-

1.Start

2.Taking the value of radius from the user

3.importing math library

4.Putting the formula of area of circle

5.Printing the area

6.End

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CODE-3:
=

First math library is imported which calculates the value of log100 base 10 value.

ALGORITHM:
-

1.Start

2.Import math liabrary

3.perform log 100 base 10

4.end




CONCLUSION:
=
Python is a powerful, simple, and versatile programming language that is easy to learn and widely used in many fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development. Its clear syntax helps beginners understand programming concepts quickly, while its large collection of libraries makes it useful for solving real-world problems efficiently. With strong community support and cross-platform compatibility.
hence we have here also seen use of print fucntion and operations in variables.
